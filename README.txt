Set a minimum purchase amount for Woocommerce orders.  Displays a validation message on both the cart and checkout pages and prevents orders below the set amount.

== Description ==

The **Minimum Order Amount for Checkout** plugin allows you to set a minimum purchase amount for Woocommerce orders.  The minimum amount can be based on the cart's subtotal or total (including fees and taxes).  The plugin displays a customizable error notification on both the cart and checkout pages. It also prevents an order from being submitted until the threshold amount has been satisfied.

The cart and checkout validation messages can be customized in the Woocommerce settings.



== Installation ==

To install and configure the plugin:

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins -> Add New' screen.
2. Activate the plugin on the 'Plugins -> Installed Plugins' page in WordPress.
3. Navigate to 'Woocommerce -> Settings' and update the settings under the 'Minimum Order Amount' tab.

Under settings, you can set the minimum order amount, whether the validation message should be triggered on the cart's subtotal or total (including fees / taxes), and you can customize the validation message for both the Cart page and the Checkout page.  When editing the validation message, there are three replacement strings available which will display the corresponding values in the message:
- [minimum] = the minimum order amount in your set currency, e.g. "$50.00".
- [total] = the value used for triggering the message, either "total" or "subtotal".
- [current] = the cart's current total or subtotal in your set currency, e.g. "$25.00".
